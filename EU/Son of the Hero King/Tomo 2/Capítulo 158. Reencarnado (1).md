Han pasado dos días desde la discusión con Ambrosia. 

La apertura del reino Astral no fue solo para el príncipe, sino para todos los nobles o personas con circunstancias especiales que fueran elegibles. 

Por supuesto, la mayoría de las veces no podrían conseguir un buen espíritu. 

Después de todo, un contrato era una calle de doble sentido. 

¿Por qué un espíritu se afiliaría a alguien que tenía bajas perspectivas? 

Los espíritus podían ser bondadosos, pero no eran ovejas dóciles. 

Afortunadamente, en unos seis días, el portal se abriría. 

Los demás tendrían un día en el tiempo del mundo real para encontrar un espíritu. 

Mientras tanto, el tiempo concedido a Sol era ilimitado. 

Pero claro, con la situación de Lilith y la guerra que se avecinaba, solo tenía unos dos meses en el tiempo del mundo real. 

La razón por la que era importante precisarlo era que la diferencia de tiempo entre el Mundo Astral y el Mundo Mortal era bastante cutre. 

El tiempo no sólo se movía más rápido o más lento. 

El espacio y el tiempo estaban completamente entrelazados, tanto que diez años en el mundo astral podían ser un día en el mundo mortal o un día en el mundo astral podían ser diez años en el mundo mortal. 

Durante esos dos días Sol no estuvo inactivo. 

Había llegado a comprender que, aunque tenía talento, simplemente no tenía tiempo suficiente para transformar su talento en fuerza real. 

Por eso había estado usando el mundo de Medea como lugar de entrenamiento siempre que no estaba ocupado con su trabajo real. 

A Medea por sí sola le costaba mantener la máxima potencia de aceleración del tiempo, pero con la ayuda de Ambrosia, se convirtió en un juego de niños. 

Durante esos tiempos, entrenaba con Freya y desarrollaba su relación con ella al mismo tiempo. 

Uno de los puntos de su entrenamiento fue manejar mejor su dimensión.

Por lo que vio de ese ángel llamado Nihil, el potencial de los magos dimensionales no tenía precedentes.

Esto fue confirmado aún más por Ambrosia mientras lo miraba con envidia.

Según lo que ella le contó, el requisito para convertirse en un Semidiós era la creación de un territorio. 

La Zona era la proyección del mundo interior. Incluso cuando se utilizaba en el exterior, no era más que una ilusión. 

El Avatar era el segundo yo o, en cierto modo, el yo real. 

Finalmente, el Territorio era la capacidad de traer el mundo interior al mundo real y afectar la realidad al mismo tiempo, fusionándose con el Avatar y convirtiéndose en uno.

Pero hubo muchos problemas. Después de todo, no sólo era increíblemente difícil crear un Territorio, sino que sería fantástico si el resultado pudiera cubrir varios kilómetros. 

Al final, cuanto más grande era un territorio, más fuerte era. Al mismo tiempo, cuanto más grande intentaba ser, más fuertes eran las leyes del mundo que lo restringían. 

That's where Dimensional Mages could be said to be cheaters. After all, they could use their dimension to serve as a Territory, and depending on the quality of the dimension, the result would be incredible.

This meant that for a Dimensional mage, as long as they could reach the King level, then it was enough. 

When he heard this, Sol's breath couldn't help but stagnate.

After all, if he wasn't wrong...His mirror dimension covered the whole mortal world.

-----

His current training with Freya consisted of entering and exiting his dimension as fast as possible.

From what Ambrosia said, rather than fumbling around uselessly, it was better to master the base.

As for better and more specific training, his grandmother, Tiamat was also a dimensional mage, and as such could guide him.

Even though Sol had more than enough Mana to spare, the calculations necessary to transition from one dimension to another were weighing heavily on his brain.

Normally, this kind of calculation happened instantly, but after a while, his brain became so sluggish it felt like it was frying.

Medea could not use her time power to reset him since it would essentially reduce his training to nothing.

Thankfully, his endurance as a hybrid was off the chart, so he just needed a few moments of rest to be in top shape again and continue.

One of Sol's favorite moment was after the training.

Currently, he was breathing heavily, his topless body glistening with sweat.

On the side, Ambrosia, Persephone, and Medea sat in reclining chairs and observed the spectacle.

Like how men liked to observe beautiful and sexy women, women also liked to watch and admire handsome men.

For once, they weren't wearing their usual dress, but rather different kinds of swimsuits.

Though, each swimsuit respected its wearer's original color scheme.

Medea was wearing a one-piece black swimsuit. Even though it didn't show much, it went perfectly with her cute appearance.

Meanwhile, Persephone and Ambrosia were wearing far bolder swimsuits.

At least, the white one worn by Ambrosia was just really sexy and showed much of her deep cleavage. But it was still in the realm of acceptable.

The green one of Persephone though was so indecent it basically left nothing to the imagination.

Since Persephone and Ambrosia had more mature bodies, the swimsuits suited them extremely well.

Finally, Freya who was standing next to him and supervising his training was wearing a pink two-piece swimsuit as well as a cloak on her shoulder.

The swimsuit wasn't particularly revealing and looked more like worn by a swimming coach or guard.

For Sol, training while admiring a bunch of sexy or cute girls was pretty good, but what pleased him more than anything.

"Towel."

Stretching his hand, he waited patiently, then a hot towel was placed in his hand.

"Here."

"Here, who?"

He could hear the sound caused by the rough breathing of repressed anger behind him.

"Here, M-Master."

The word was said in a stuttering and barely audible way, but this didn't stop Sol's lips from curving into a mean smile.

Turning around, he glanced at the red-haired girl wearing a maid dress, or rather, what looked like it.

After all, the hem of the skirt was so short it barely covered her butt. Meanwhile, the top was nearly transparent and showed her chest devoid of a bra.

Even Ketia, who loved wearing skimpy clothes would be too embarrassed to be seen out with something like this.

In the first place, for a witch, their color was basically like their greatest pride. A witch could only be bestowed a color when her skills were recognized by Ambrosia.

That's why, for a witch, being forced to wear colors other than her own was one of the greatest humiliations possible. 

But did Sol care about her feeling of shame and humiliation?

"See? You can do it if you try, Kali."

The answer was obviously, no.

In fact, he couldn't be happier.

Kali, the witch of destruction, a woman who could single-handedly wipe out the capital of a Kingdom in a few moments was nowhere to be seen.

What replaced her was a girl so embarrassed and humiliated that her face became as red as her hair.

The look of shame, the feeling of powerlessness she showed, her gritted teeth and clenched fist. 

Knowing that the woman in front of him, who should have been strong enough to wipe him out from existence, had no choice but to swallow all her grievances and obey his order, Sol had to admit that he had never felt so excited in his life.

This sensation of rush fed his ego and pride so much that he felt satiated.

The only blemish was that he knew that she didn't bow to his authority. But it still didn't stop him from feeling happy.

Technically, it has already been many days since she became his maid.

Of course, she was still his sister-in-law, as such, he wouldn't force her to wear such degrading clothes when outside.

Sol also had to admit that there was some feeling of possession at play.

After all, no matter how he got her, she was his maid. Why would he let anyone else gaze at her body?

'Though there isn't really much to gaze at.'

He looked critically at her body as he thought that.

"What?"

Feeling anger at where his gaze was, Kali asked, but Sol simply shook his head, 

"Nothing. I just thought that an airport runway had its charm."

"What!? What's wrong with being flat!?"

Sol gazed intently at her as he made his joke and when he saw her reaction, a feeling of joy sprung in his heart.

'She understood my joke!'

At the same time, Kali's anger immediately cooled down when she thought once again about the joke and slowly lifted her head, her expression showing how surprised and shaken she was.

After all, 

'Planes did not exist in this world.'
